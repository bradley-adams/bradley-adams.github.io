          <h5>Whats your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
          <p>I believe it is different from any other learning enviroment I have come across in the past. Genuinely colaborate. Very involved and fast paced.</p>

          <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
          <p>It feels good so far. I get a great feeling of achievement from the
          learning. Its a process of change which I find hard and rewarding.</p>

          <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
          <p>A little unsure. I haven't had any expereince in this industry nor do I
          know anyone who works in it. I like meeting new people and engaging with
          them which should help. I think being genuine and staying involved will
          be key.</p>

          <h5>Have your expectiations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h5>
          <p>Yes. I came into this expecting my skills to change. Now I am expecting
          to have a new outlook on a lot of topics including different cultures,
          how I'm learning and how I understand people.</p>

          <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment? Does
          it make you nervous?</h5>
          <p>Yes at the same time. I was very nervous and still am. But the more I do
          the more I find it turning into excitment. My confidence is growing with
          the parts I complete.</p>
