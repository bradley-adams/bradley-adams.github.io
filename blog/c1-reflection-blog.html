      Whats your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
      I believe it is different from any other learning enviroment I have come
      across in the past. Genuinely colaborate. Very involved and fast paced.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are your impressions?
      It feels good so far. I get a great feeling of achievement from the
      learning. Its a process of change which I find hard and rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      A little unsure. I haven't had any expereince in this industry nor do I
      know anyone who works in it. I like meeting new people and engaging with
      them which should help. I think being genuine and staying involved will
      be key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your expectiations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      Yes. I came into this expecting my skills to change. Now I am expecting
      to have a new outlook on a lot of topics including different cultures,
      how I'm learning and how I understand people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment? Does
      it make you nervous?
      Yes at the same time. I was very nervous and still am. But the more I do
      the more I find it turning into excitment. My confidence is growing with
      the parts I complete.
