          <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
          <p>JavaScript is more difficult. Rather then formating to make things appear its like you are contralling what different things do. Your creating a process in which different things can get done. Its kind of like creating a nice picture on paint compared with creating a clip on powerpoint.</P>

          <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
          <p>Control flows and loops are like driving to work in the morning. There is a certain order things are done. You grab your keys first. Then open your car. Then turn it on. Each of these has to be done before the other. Then a loop is best described when you get to the first interesection after leaving your house. You look left and there is a car coming so you wait. You then repeat that process until there is an empty gap and the result is you can pull out into traffic safely.</p>

          <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
          <p>Not to sure one this but I believe objects are almost everything in JavaScript which can be edited to be more specific. Where arrays are numerical but you can still asign none numberical data to the numbers.</p>

          <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
          <p>I find this hard to explain. Functions are bits of JavaScript that do something. If you want Javascript to perform an action then you essentially want a function. For example you can use a function to covert measurements like inches to mm. The function can also do this over and over again even when only writing the code once. Useful because it means lots and lots of conversions instantly.</P>
