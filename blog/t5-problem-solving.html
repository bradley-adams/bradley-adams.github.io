          <h5>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
          <h5>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>

          <b>What was the problem?</b>
          <p>In the colour exercise where you used Javascript to click on the circles and change their colours I got stuck on a couple of small things and I worked them out in a few different ways. The first one was for some reason when I wrote code it wouldn’t work versus copying code and then editing to reflect new colours it would work.</P>

          <b>What problem solving techniques did you use?</b>
          <p>Well I got involved in a bit of trial and error. I would put this under just giving something a go. I rewrote all code and it still didn’t work. I then started copying and pasting code that was already written to pin point the error. I found that when I deleted the calling of the code (or code that got the website started) it would work. From here learning that you should write this bit last.</p>

          <b>How did you feel throughout the process?</b>
          <p>I got quite nervous because what was being asked wasn’t complicated in terms of what I needed to do. I probably read to far ahead in instructions and then tried to do to many solutions at the same time. I was a good reminder that a lot of code is done in a specific order for a reason. I did feel great once I got it finished. Maybe even more because I managed to solve my own problem by myself and I also understood why.</p>

          <b>What did you learn?</b>
          <p>I learnt a lesson in testing as I go. Checking little bits are working correctly before moving onto the next problem. Otherwise you can write some much code and the mistake could be anywhere. I also learnt to stick to the designed process. Which seems straight forward given that most of what we are learning has prerequisites but I must have been rushing or looking to far ahead.</P>

          <h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h5>

          <b>Pseudocode</b>
          <p>I do this a bit but probably should do it a but more. Great idea on the tricky bits to figure out wither your theory was where I was getting things wrong or the techniques your applying to the theory. I am confident doing this as I don’t see how you can muck it up.</P>

          <b>Trying something</b>
          <p>Very confident in this as its pretty much how I approach most of the problem solving so far. Trial and error type learning.</p>

          <b>Rubber ducky method</b>
          <p>Not to sure on this. When writing things I used to us this method a lot so I would say I’m confident in using it but not with code.</P>

          <b>Reading error messages</b>
          <p>I always try to process any reply I get from my work. I think it gives you clues about solutions or nothing a all.</p>

          <b>Console.logging</b>
          <p>Not to sure what is meant by this but I think its around trying to execute the code even though all the lines of code may not be finished. This I am confident with and do reguarly.</p>

          <b>Googling</b>
          <p>Probably my most popular problem solver. Happy using this normally after I have tried something or written some Pseudocode. I would read and take in any error messages. They could be useful key words when searching.</p>

          <b>Asking your peers for help</b>
          <p>The one I am least confident in doing. I have reached out once and it was really easy. I also go a really good response. For some reason it is still the one I fear heading towards. Mainly I don't wont to waste anyones time incase the issue is really simple</p>

          <b>Asking coaches for help</b>
          <p>More confident asking staff for help then I would be asking peers. I have done this a couple of times but nothing major yet.</p>

          <b>Improving your process with reflection</b>
          <p>I haven’t started journaling yet as suggested in this weeks chapter of Search inside yourself. But I do see that as being a key step here. I do look back and think about what have a done far. I’m definitely picking up a lot as a go along so its good to look back on that but sometimes I start to wonder how much is actually sinking in. I’m not confident in my reflection but I do think it helps or it will help.</p>
