          <h5>What is grid based design?</h5>
          <p>Grid based design is designing structure of your website around a grid of columns and rows. The grids and rows intersect the page which creates sections where you can put your content.</p>

          <h5>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5>
          <p> Responsive websites are all about seeing your website properly on different size screens. Its about setting up your design correctly so the website can be viewed on different devices like a desktop, laptop or cellphone</p>

          <h5>What is semantic structure?</h5>
          <p>Basically its about being more specific. Semantic structure is doing away with generic tags like div in favour of more specific ones. Tags like p or h3 describe what is happening inside them. P is a paragraph and h3 is the 3rd biggest or third important heading on the page.</p>

          <h5>Other Point</h5>
          <p>I quite enjoyed learning the bits about Bootstrap. There is a lot of content to learn and discover but I found it easy to find. Also I like the idea of essentially pre written CSS especially for bit on pages where styling in the HTML and CSS takes a lot of time.</p>
