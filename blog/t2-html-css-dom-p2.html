    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid based design is designing structure of your website around a grid
      of columns and rows. The grids and rows intersect the page which creates
      sections where you can put your content.</p>
    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p> Responsive websites are all about seeing your website properly on
      different size screens. Its about setting up your design correctly so the
      website can be viewed on different devices like a desktop, laptop or
      cellphone</p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Basically its about being more specific. Semantic structure is doing
        away with generic tags like div in favour of more specific ones. Tags
        like p or h3 describe what is happening inside them. P is a paragraph
        and h3 is the 3rd biggest or third important heading on the page.</p>
    <h3>Other Point</h3>
      <p>I quite enjoyed learning the bits about Bootstrap. There is a lot of
        content to learn and discover but I found it easy to find. Also I like
        the idea of essentially pre written CSS especially for bit on pages
        where styling in the HTML and CSS takes a lot of time.</p>
