          <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
          <p>They are very similar or even the same. Both are looking into some when surrounded by other factors. I see Self-awareness as reflecting upon yourself in trying times or even good times with high emotions. Mindfulness is a little broader as in you could be focusing on something or in general and being aware of how your doing it. This would be my grasp of the two ideas.</p>

          <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
          <p>The Body scan was interesting. I often felt my self reminiscing about the past when focused on different parts of the body. I guess I was finding all sorts of emotions. Happy times with things like haircuts or sad times like hurting my back. I felt a bit muddled and sometimes like I was rushing through things. Originally I was thinking I have gone completely off track and haven't found any emotions. As I write this now I realise that the events I remembered were definitely different emotions. Flashbulb.</p>

          <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
          <p>I think I understood what was being said. That sometimes your might get sad or happy but that is not you that is what your feeling. When you understand that these emotions can keep changes then you can change them yourself. I gist I got was that creating the separation makes it easier to change.</p>
