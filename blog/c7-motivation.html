          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>Life looks good. When reading this I kept relating it to getting a high. Things like drugs or alcohol providing a temporary pleasure. Getting a Passion high would be like completing a gym exercise and almost forgetting you have done it yet you’re getting the benefits. The final high or hardest high being Higher Purpose where I got this image of sitting at my kid’s graduation. Sitting there thinking that nothing can take the high away of raising someone who has reached such a high themselves. A full sense of purpose in life.</p>

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h4>
          <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
          <p>I did struggle to get some significant info down here. I think my core values are something to do with family and people. Being able to keep people close and help them do things. I think charity starts at home. Keeping your mind as open as much as possible and challenging everything. Not just being a sheep.</p>

          <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
          <p>I would like to think I stand for the little guy. The different guy. I value different perspectives. I would stand up for my family in any situation. Seeing it grow and live life would be something to protect. </p>

          <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>I find it hard to let some things go. I would say I used to be a lot worse. Taking a drive with me explains this a lot. After meeting my wife I looked at my family and realised how bad it was. Inner calm came a lot quicker with the meditation. Failure is a hard one for me. I haven’t handled it well in the past. I think embracing it would be the first step. Noticing it as temporary. Explaining the failure and moving on.</p>

          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>I found this chapter quite relevant to the sprint 7 work. I failed some of the recent function questions in eloquent and freecodecamp. I struggled to get a lot done in the timeboxed timeframes. But I had some moments of “just chill” given that this was my first go at a lot of these type of questions.</p>
