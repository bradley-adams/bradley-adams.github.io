          <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
          <p>I think I have had good leaders and bad leaders. I have definitely made friends with people out of bad situations. On the other hand, I have lost respect of leaders who I see having little or no compassion. I agree that compassion could be a defining factor in leadership.</p>

          <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>I found it hard. I get the idea but struggle to execute. Found myself think about avatar and how they can connect with people and then the spirit tree. Like connecting with your goodness, a persons goodness and the goodness in the world. Random thought. Easily relatable to the just like me exercise. Having goodness and giving goodness.</p>

          <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>The step up but I found it a good idea. If you talking to someone about a bad situation and focusing on taking their sadness or worry and turning it into goodness then things are going to flow. Your essentially providing people with goodness from sadness to turn them back into a state which as the book says is where we want to be. Happy. </p>

          <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>I found this a little hard to relate. In my interactions with classmates and others in Phase 0. For example, Autonomy can be hard when working with people. You can get annoyed easily in these situations. On bootcamp I think one part to apply would be relatedness because we need to come into this course with an open mind. Assume friends rather than foes.</p>

          <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
          <p>I havenâ€™t had the chance since reading this. Only situation was returning an item which was faulty. I probably worked this up to be worse than it was. I did try to walk through the conversation and see their side. Not an ideal difficult conversation but it was at least something to try on.</p>
