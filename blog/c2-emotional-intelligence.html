  <h1>B W Adams Emotional Intelligence</h1>
  <h2>19th December 2017</h2>

  <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p>
      The best bit that I took away was that in finding out where you are
      emotionally makes it easier to find out where others are at. You need
      emotional intelligence for others to almost unlock your own general
      intelligence. In gaining emotional intelligence you can almost improve
      what your already doing. It can even create new opportunities like
      leadership. The final learning that stood out would be around Body and
      Mind. With trying to find your own emotions it is sometimes easier and
      quicker to listen to your body rather than your mind.

  <h3>How did you find the two minutes of midfulness?</h3>
    <p>
      Hard. I had to restart a couple of time because a few distrations came up.
      I found my mind wandering easily and I would have to rein it in and
      concentrate on my breathing again. Going to try again before I go to bed.
      I am expecting better results.
