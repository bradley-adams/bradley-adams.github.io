    <h1>B W Adams Time and Habit Reflection</h1>
    <h2><em></em></h2>
    <h3>21st November 2017</h3>

    <p>
Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
Meditation. Downloaded headspace. Guided meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
What did you find interesting?
Video by Fogg on tiny habits. Never thought about piggy backing new habits on
the back of what I'm currently doing.
    </p>
    <p>
What worked for you?
Unsure at the moment. A few of the things I would like to try may take some
some time before they bare fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
Which will you experiment further with?
Tiny habits. I want to try push ups after pee type thing. I have quite a strick
schedule so this should work well. Thinking wake up situp might be a good idea.
Driving meditation might be work looking into. My guided meditations
on headspace wouldnt work.
