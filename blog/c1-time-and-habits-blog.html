    <h1>B W Adams Time and Habit Reflection</h1>
    <h2><em></em></h2>
    <h3>21st November 2017</h3>

    <p>
which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
Meditation. Downloaded headspace. Guided meditation.
what did you find interesting?
Video by Fogg on tiny habits. Never thought about piggy backing new habits on
the back of what I'm currently doing.
what worked for you?
Unsure at the moment. A few of the things I would like to try may take some
some time before they bare fruits.
which will you experiment further with?
Tiny habits. I want to try push ups after pee type thing. I have quite a strick
schedule so this should work well. Thinking wake up situp might be a good idea.
Driving meditation might be work looking into. My guided meditations
on headspace wouldnt work.
