          <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
          <p>Meditation. Downloaded headspace. Guided meditation.</p>

          <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
          <p>Video by Fogg on tiny habits. Never thought about piggy backing new habits on the back of what I'm currently doing.</p>

          <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
          <p>Unsure at the moment. A few of the things I would like to try may take some time before they bare fruits.</p>

          <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
          <p>Tiny habits. I want to try push ups after pee type thing. I have quite a strick schedule so this should work well. Thinking wake up situp might be a good idea. Driving meditation might be work looking into. My guided meditations on headspace wouldnt work.</p>
