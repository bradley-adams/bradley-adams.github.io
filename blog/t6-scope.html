          <h4>Explain to a non-tech friend what 'scope' is in Javascript</h4>
          <p>
            There are 2 parts of scope. Global and local. They name suggest exactly what they do. Essentially, imagine a building a with a different apartment on each floor. Each owner has a key to their own apartment but the caretaker has keys for all apartments. Local scope in this case would be apartment owners and global scope would be the caretaker. In terms of coding the global scope would be like variables declared inside the document and not inside a function can then be accessed anywhere inside the document. On the other hand, local scope could be seen as a variable declared inside a function can only be seen/used inside that function.
