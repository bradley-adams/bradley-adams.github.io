          <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
          <p>As I was reading this so many different situations dropped into my head. I guess there are some obvious triggers like writing what you think is a perfect solution to a questions or a good bit of code only for it to be wrong or not work. I find my self triggered by finally finishing something then getting tripped up by something else right after I have finished. For example if I finished writing this cultural blog and linked it to everything but I make a mistake pushing it to GitHub wasting more time. I get triggered when things take more time then I expect. Most of these triggers cause a disproportionate response and I can feel it physically overcome me. The worst part to this is I find it hard to concentrate again afterwards. My productivity is always affected. In the last 2-3 weeks I have been dealing with it a lot better as I have realized this is something very new to me. Its meant to be hard and challenging for everyone and it is probably going to be more difficult for someone who has never tried these things before.

          <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
          <p>I enjoyed this. It seems so simple. I'm in my last week of work and have had many chances to practice this with a lot of mistakes being made. It was a little hard to remember the steps fully and even shorten them at first. I got some interesting looks when I was told about mistakes as I took some time to response. Some people obviously got a bit nervous. Time helped to put things into perspective then I could try and react appropriately.</p>
