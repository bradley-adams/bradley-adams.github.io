          <h5>How did the "process over product" concept affec the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>I tried to complete more of what I hadn't tried before liking working in preset classes even though they didnt have the best look. For example I tried buttons but they came out blue which I tired to match to the heading background but couldnt achieve. Instead of wasting a lot of time trying to find the right blue I instead changed to yellow as a joke (worst colour for a website) and moved onto some more features. It was hard to do knowing things didnt look great on my site but I was leaning the process and gathering skills. It also meant I thought I learnt a lot more about the frameworks then if I was trying to create a good looking website rather then learning a process.</p>

          <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
          <p>I wasnt to sure. I had tried using headspace but then had to delete the app after it was causing problems. I havn't meditation formally since then. I have however taken a lot of time off work recently. High stress periods around my wedding followed by long relaxing days sometimes just sitting on the beach watching people.</p>

          <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
          <p>The biggest one would be that your mind affects your body. Meditation can help me with some many other aspects of my body rather then just a relaxed mind. I learnt that meditation can just start with an intention.</p>

          <h5> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          <p>Its hard to say. I felt like most of the techniques said were similar or the same as the headspace techniques. Using intention is a good thing to think about. The bits about getting back on track when things happen around you is something I think could help. Acknowledge, experience and let go</p>

          <h5>Any other musing?</h5>
          <p>I had a lot of time for reflection at the start of this year. Looked at how our year went. Where we stuggled as a team and what we wanted to change. My partner and I both wanted to start enjoying our work again, spend more time with family and grow some good habits. This might have been my most eye opening cultural week yet. I got some good hours into sprint 3 and almost finished it in one week. I realise that meditation is something I really need to do and could have been why I was enjoy some of the past patches. It could also help with my health goals and academic goals.</p>
