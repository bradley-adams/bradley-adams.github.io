          <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
          <p>Yes. It went well I think. I didn’t really evaluate the conversation with the participant afterwards. I feel like the conversation with this particular person lasted longer than they normally did. I didn’t get an indication of them being more or less interested then normally. I tried picturing people just like me as I was walking to work. I found myself doing a few things differently.</p>

          <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
          <p> I got hold of a few feelings. I talked to someone about the recent marriage. Simple starting didn’t you get married recently and how are you finding it. I tried reiterating some feelings but didn’t say them directly. Also, I didn’t get a chance to ask how the conversation went. Rather informal but I did find myself picking up on different feelings.</p>

          <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
          <p>Very good. It can completely change what you do in the simplest situation. I read this bit of the book just after finishing up at the gym and walking to EDA. I found myself evaluating people along the way. From delivery men to commuters. Without trying I found myself smiling at so many people. Generally, put me in a great mood to start the day. Waiting to use this in my marriage.</p>

          <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
          <p>My situation would be borrowing money from family. Someone I know borrowed some money from their father for a car. They organised the loan with interest, repayments, etc. The other siblings got wind of the situation and didn't see it as a business deal rather than ripping the father off. The son who bought the car thought he did the right thing setting it up as a traditional loan but didn’t inform his siblings. His sisters did jump to conclusions but should have ask the details before speculating. The son wants a car for his family in the right way but the sisters don’t want their father taken advantage off. Both are reasonable intentions.</p>
