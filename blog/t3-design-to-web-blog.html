          <h5>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is importatnt.</h5>
          <p>A responsive site allows visitors to access your site from a range of devices without the layout becoming distorted. The site will react to the size of the screen it is being displayed on then adjust the layout appropriately. The content of the site will be the same or similar. On smaller screens such as a mobile we may remove unnecessary items like pictures. Responsive websites are important because peoples needs seem to change with their screen size they are accessing the site with. You can assume that with smaller screens people need quick and easy to read information. We assum that the site is less about the extras or finishes and more about information in a quick and legible small page. Bigger screens assume that people have more time and can take in some more finishing touches. Taking out extras on the smaller screens will also allow it to load quick especially in bad reception areas.</p>

          <h5>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h5>
          <p>Mobile first design is creating your website for a smaller screen like a mobile screen and then expanding from there. You make sure you site suits a small screen then as the screen size increases you can use the space that creates for more features. Creating a site to a small screen is generally harder (trying to fit a lot of information into a small space) so its almost creating the hardest bit first then adding from there. Its important because it can keep consistency over the screen sizes. It also saves creating a whole new website for a mobile.</p>

          <h5>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h5>
          <p>Frameworks are essentially auto formatting for your website. The frameworks create other CSS pages which you can link to. They store premade formatting which is then applied to your website. Using classes around the grid based system gives you a nice layout and headings will be consistent over all pages that link to the same framework. Pros are everything looks the some over all you pages. The design all works together from picture formatting to headings and boarders. The cons are there isn’t a lot or options. Their aren’t as many options as if you created the CSS from scratch.</p>

          <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h5>
          <p>Wireframe is essentially drawing the basic layout of your website before you start writing any code. It is a mock up or plan of what you are going to try to achieve. We use it as a first step to creating a new page. It essentially is a visual plan of what we are hoping to create.</p>

          <h5>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h5>
          <p>Some things were difficult because of small errors such as not linking to my custom CSS page properly. This in turn would not allow me to format my picture how I wanted. It also took some time to realise to get the picture itself to behave then I needed to add some custom CSS suggested from the skeleton website. I went with buttons for the navigation section which took some time to think through.</p>
