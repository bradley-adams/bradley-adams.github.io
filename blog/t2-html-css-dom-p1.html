          <h5>Design and structural features</h5>
          <h6>CSS Garden</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Steel was one design that had boxes which moved like movie credits being pulled up by crains in the background. I liked how simple it was with about 8-10 sections on the page. Black and White colour screme. I think a stationary background would look good on my own website.</li>
            <li>Leggo My Ego has big picture/header which captures your attention and then a pretty simple 3 colum layout. Subheadings or smaller colum headings are a little bit weird. Links in the middle seem like a good idea to me.</li>
            <li>I didnt like all of Zen City Morning but one feature I would like to try is the right side city/border. Something a little different and I thought it would look quite good.</li>
            <li>Contempo Finery I thought looked probably the best. A very Simple colour sceme. Everything into rounded boarders but also kept in nice colums. Distinctions between boxes with background shading/colour and some 2 tone. It almosts contradicts what I wrote before hand but I like how its not trying to cram heaps of info into the top left corner.</li>
            <li>Garmets was the last design on Css Zen Gardens that I looked at. Very simple and different to some of the others I have written about. No real borders, boxes or colums. Alot of there links are just a simple design to explain where they are going rather then spelling it out. It has a stationary background like Steel but no moving boxes/boarders which I think I like more.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Website I use</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Google - Changing logo it fun. Not sure if that is from people changing it or something you can do automatically.</li>
            <li>Trademe - I find it easy to use and I think its from easy index page layout. In saying that there is also a lot of crap on the home page. Maybe I could try something around there category navigation.</li>
            <li>Stuff - (I know terrible news source but strangely addictive). They have a tidy most popular section or the right of the front page. I could try something like that.</li>
            <li>Facebook - A lot of photots and videos. I wouldnt use as many but still I think it would be a good idea to use some.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>What is an analogy to Desibe HTML, CSS and Dom?</h5>
          <p>I would probably use the building analogy from the Udacity videos. A house needs structure which is similar to a website needs HTML. CSS is the design like flooring, painting and furniture. Dom can be described as a access or visiting the hoouse. Someone used a key or remote to get in or acces the house and interprets what you have built and arranged</P>

          <h5>What is boxifying design?</h5>
          <p>In simple it means every website is made up on boxes and in most cases boxes inside boxes. Even if things appear to be circles they are boxes in terms of space allocated to them on the page.<p>

          <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
          <p>Esentially it helps you determin the widths and heights of an element. For example you can have a picture with and ousite that thing like padding, border and margins add to it. So your actual width of you elemnt is content plus those other items.</p>
