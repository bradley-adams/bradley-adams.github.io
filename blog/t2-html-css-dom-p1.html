<h3>Design and structural features I liked</h3>

<h4>CSS Garden</h4>
<p>Steel was one design that had boxes which moved like movie credits being
pulled up by crains in the background. I liked how simple it was with about
8-10 sections on the page. Black and White colour screme. I think a stationary
background would look good on my own website.</p>

<p>Leggo My Ego has big picture/header which captures your attention and then a
pretty simple 3 colum layout. Subheadings or smaller colum headings are a little
bit weird. Links in the middle seem like a good idea to me.<p>

<p>I didnt like all of Zen City Morning but one feature I would like to try is the
right side city/border. Something a little different and I thought it would
look quite good.</p>

<p>Contempo Finery I thought looked probably the best. A very Simple colour sceme.
Everything into rounded boarders but also kept in nice colums. Distinctions
between boxes with background shading/colour and some 2 tone. It almosts
contradicts what I wrote before hand but I like how its not trying to cram
heaps of info into the top left corner.</p>

<p>Garmets was the last design on Css Zen Gardens that I looked at. Very simple
and different to some of the others I have written about. No real borders, boxes
or colums. Alot of there links are just a simple design to explain where they
are going rather then spelling it out. It has a stationary background like
Steel but no moving boxes/boarders which I think I like more.</p>

<h4>Website I use</h4>
<p>Google - Changing logo it fun. Not sure if that is from people changing it
or something you can do automatically.
Trademe - I find it easy to use and I think its from easy index page layout. In
saying that there is also a lot of crap on the home page. Maybe I could try
something around there category navigation.
Stuff - (I know terrible news source but strangely addictive). They have a tidy
most popular section or the right of the front page. I could try something like
that.
Facebook - A lot of photots and videos. I wouldnt use as many but still I think
it would be a good idea to use some.</p>

<h4>What is an analogy to Desibe HTML, CSS and Dom?</h4>
  <p>I would probably use the building analogy from the Udacity videos. A house
  needs structure which is similar to a website needs HTML. CSS is the design
  like flooring, painting and furniture. Dom can be described as a access or
  visiting the hoouse. Someone used a key or remote to get in or acces the house
  and interprets what you have built and arranged</P>

<h4>What is boxifying design?</h4>
  <p>In simple it means every website is made up on boxes and in most cases
  boxes inside boxes. Even if things appear to be circles they are boxes in
  terms of space allocated to them on the page.<p>

<h4>What is the box model?</h4>
  <p>Esentially it helps you determin the widths and heights of an element.
  For example you can have a picture with and ousite that thing like padding,
  border and margins add to it. So your actual width of you elemnt is content
  plus those other items.</p>
