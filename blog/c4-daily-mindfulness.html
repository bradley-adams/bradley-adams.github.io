          <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
          <p>I tried it with my wife and found it a little hard. I found that I already dabble in looping but I always figured it was because I have terrible hearing. I did find it easiest to put away the phones and turn off the TV then try to do this over dinner. It game us time for pauses and didn't make it as awkward if no one was saying anything. I felt better after dinner. Like we had achieved something while conversing. I learn't that what I thought she was talking about vs what she was trying to say often took 2 or 3 more loops to get to the same conclusion. This surprised me as we have lived together for 5 years or more and if there is anyone I would want to understand fully it would be her. She did find it awkward but I think enjoyed it in the end. I think she got to talk about a lot of organizing things which helped her a lot. Especially because I couldn't interrupt. </p>

          <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
          <p>Every time I think about meditation and mainly what I am not doing I am consciously taking one deep breath. I have been poor with my meditating over the last couple of weeks. I used to open up at work and therefor have a couple of minutes before everyone arrives where I could meditate. But now with shift changes people come in earlier and its hard to find a quiet spot at work. This almost includes the technique of doing less then you can. I could do more then a breath but  I might try waking up 15min earlier and meditate before getting out of bed. Also, I think I'm going to buy the search inside yourself book and give it to my partner. See if I can get a buddy on this journey. By that I mean after doing the mindfulness conversation my partner wants to read the book.</p>

          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>Probably my most enjoyable chapter to read. The sustaining techniques were something I needed. I enjoyed starting but getting through the consistency is something I have struggled with. I am having some real work challenges at the moment and I think the benefits of meditation is something that could help. It was also good to have some understanding or encouraging thoughts around the lack of progress early on.</p>
